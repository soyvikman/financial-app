# Devsu Code Challenge

## Overview
Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ This is Victor Castro's submission for the Devsu code challenge. In this repository, you'll find all the functionality you asked for, following the Angular structure and best practices outlined in the awesome article [Angular Code Structuring and Best Practices](https://dev.to/codecraftjs/angular-code-structuring-and-best-practices-nkd).

## Structure
I've organized the code using a pattern by feature for large and scalable apps, making sure it's modular and easy to maintain.

### Features Implemented
- [Feature 1: Visualization]
- [Feature 2: Just an example]


## Functionality
I'm happy to report that all the required functionality is in place and ready to roll.

## Testing
I'm currently working on a project that needs to go into production, and unfortunately, I wasn't able to complete the testing part. I regret that.

## Installation and Execution
To get this project up and running, just follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [repository_url]

2. Navigate to the project directory:

cd project-directory

3. Install dependencies:

npm install

4. Start the Angular development server:

ng serve

## Additional Notes
Make sure you've got Node.js and Angular CLI installed on your machine.
